        underlying transaction between the User, any other User, any third

        User’s payment instructions provided through the Site for the purposes
        of facilitating the transfer of monies to the intended beneficiary as

        other payment method that Canvas Homes accepts] or (b) to process payment

        fees or other amounts we may collect under this Agreement) to such user.

        iv. Transaction Limits: Canvas Homes may delay, suspend or reject a
        transaction for any payment(s) for any reason, including without
        limitation if Canvas Homes suspects that the transaction subjects it to
        financial or security risk or is unauthorized, fraudulent, suspicious,
        unlawful, in violation of the terms of this Agreement subject to dispute
        or otherwise unusual.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify text-base text-gray-500 mb-3 font-lato">
        v. Chargebacks: The amount of a transaction may be charged back or
        reversed to the User (a "Chargeback") if the transaction (a) is disputed
        by the sender, (b) is reversed for any reason, (c) was not authorized or
        Canvas Homes has reason to believe that the transaction was not authorized,
        or (d) is allegedly unlawful, suspicious, or in violation of the terms
        of this Agreement. The Users owe Canvas Homes and will immediately pay
        Canvas Homes the amount of any Chargeback and any associated fees, fines,
        or penalties assessed by Canvas Homes’s Processor, processing financial
        institutions, or MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Discover, and other
        payment card networks, associations, or companies ("Networks"). The
        Users agree to assist Canvas Homes when requested, at the User’s expense,
        to investigate any of the User’s transactions processed through the
        Service. For Chargebacks associated with cards, Canvas Homes will work with
        the Users to contest the Chargeback with the Network or issuing banks
        should the User choose to contest the Chargeback. In this regard,
        Canvas Homes will request necessary information from the User to contest
        the Chargeback and the User’s failure to timely assist Canvas Homes in
        investigating a transaction, including without limitation providing
        necessary documentation within 5 business days of Canvas Homes’s request,
        may result in an irreversible Chargeback.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify text-base text-gray-500 mb-3 font-lato">
        vi. Liability: The Users agree not to hold Canvas Homes responsible and/or
        liable for any issue or claim arising out of any dispute whatsoever
        between the User and the Processor and/or the User and the User’s bank
        or financial institution.

      <p class="text-justify text-base text-gray-500 mb-3 font-lato">
        Additionally, please note that Canvas Homes shall not be responsible for
        any additional fees or charges deducted by the Processors while
        processing payments in connection with the User’s transaction and
        Canvas Homes disclaims all liability in this regard. Further, the Users may
        also be subject to additional terms and conditions imposed by such
        Processors and the Users should review these terms and conditions before
        authorizing any payments through the Processors.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify text-base text-gray-500 mb-3 font-lato">
        vii. Fraud and restrictions: Canvas Homes may ask for additional documents
        (like Rental Agreement, Owner/Tenant PAN, Maintenance Bill) where it
        deems necessary, including in case the transaction looks suspicious.
        [Canvas Homes will refund the full amount (excluding the nominal processing
        fees collected by Canvas Homes) without any deductions if Canvas Homes
        determines it is not a valid rent/token/security deposit/ maintenance
        payment or if such payment is fraudulent. A valid rent/security deposit
        payment is one where there exists a legally valid rental agreement
        between the tenant and the landlord with the rent amount equivalent to
        what is being transferred on Canvas Homes Pay. A valid maintenance payment
        is one where there exists a maintenance bill between the payer and the
        society/RWA.
